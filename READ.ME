# <password Generator>

## Description

I built the password generator to practice learning new functions and learning how to make them all work together. Before the project I did not know anything about alerts or confirm functions. Also learning how to link a function to a button listed in HTML is really important because it is easier to manipulate through HTML and CSS rather than creating a button within JS. This is one of our first actual functioning programs and it's good to start getting the ideas behind them down.

## Usage

To use the system, click the generate password button. Then you will be prompted with questions about the characters being used. Then you will have to enter the amount of characters for the password. After that it will display in the text area and boom! You have your new password.
